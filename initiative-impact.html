                                <strong>Strategic Problem Definition:</strong> I authored a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that clearly defined the problem statement, identified target audience segments, and established measurable success metrics. This foundational work ensured all stakeholders had clarity on what success looked like and aligned the prototype development with the specific needs of healthcare sales teams.

Within a single day, the prototype successfully identified conference attendees, enriched their profiles with relevant data, and integrated scheduling features to pre-book meetings.
